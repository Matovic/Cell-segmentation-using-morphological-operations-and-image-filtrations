## Assignment
Load histology image from breast cancer dataset  - [image1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15o6Dl25P6ern4JJkjArxpPdi8UPLcF6p/view), [image2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hHTTYJX6qyzY0BJbLQ21bx69Mj7LFrOv/view), [image3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UXCh_8nucjo5zA7-WqrJ_JNzmQkhO5am/view). 
Eliminate noise and binarize the image using morphological operations and contour analysis. 
Try to programmatically mark every cell and sum the total count. There are multiple solutions, use your imagination. Document each attempt, 
even if it is unsuccessful ([documentation example](https://sites.google.com/stuba.sk/vgg/computer-vision/solution-training-task?authuser=0)).
Use [OpenCV documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.7.0/), below are some tips you may try.
Optional Datasets: [Beer bubbles](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jg_o5izpma-RUc8296SOjPau5ypruWnE/view), [red blood cells](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FThJGItE_jSzne2LgcStj9Q4sLILPDWj)
Choose at least 2 images (of your choice) for this Assignment !

## Usage
To run Jupyter Notebook, you need OpenCV and matplotlib. You can install them using pip:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Solution
### 1. Load image and convert to grayscale
Image resizing:
```python
# percent by which the image is resized
scale_percent = 50

# calculate the 50 percent of original dimensions
width = int(img1.shape[1] * scale_percent / 100)
height = int(img1.shape[0] * scale_percent / 100)

# dsize
dsize = (width, height)

img1_resize = cv2.resize(img1, dsize)
show_img(img1_resize, 'image')
```

### 2. Image pre-processing

### 3. Binarization

### 4. Bubble segmentation

### Filtration
